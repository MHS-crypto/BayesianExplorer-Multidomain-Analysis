## Olympics Dataset Analysis

### Part A: Assessing Host Country Advantage

In this section, we explore the potential advantage a host country may have in the Olympics. The analysis involves a Bayesian assessment of the expected number of medals per participant in the host country using a Poisson sampling model (Poisson(N1λ1)) with a Gamma prior distribution (Gamma(0.1, rate=0.1)). The results indicate that countries tend to win more medals in away games, although the difference is not highly significant.

### Part B: Bayesian Test for Home-Country Advantage

Conducting a Bayesian test, we directly sample through Monte Carlo simulation to test the hypothesis of a home-country advantage. The low posterior probabilities suggest that there isn't strong evidence to support a home-country advantage, and the results are robust to different prior values.

### Part C: Country-Specific Home-Country Advantage

Examining five different countries, the analysis reveals that the home advantage varies from country to country, reinforcing the idea that the impact of hosting the Olympics differs based on the nation.

### Part D: Prediction for France in 2024 Olympics

The model predicts that France is likely to win around 37.78 medals in the 2024 Olympics, with a credible interval suggesting the true value falls between 22 and 57 medals with 95% confidence.

## Chicken Breasts Wastage Analysis

### Part A: Estimated Mean Wastage Level

The proposed chicken breasts preparation process yields an estimated mean wastage level of approximately 4.067%. The ratio of variances suggests a slight difference in wastage levels between operators.

### Part B: Sensitivity Analysis and Part C: Brief Results

Conclusions from the analysis:
- The new process maintains an average 4.71% wastage rate.
- Operators show balanced wastage performance, averaging around 0.80.
- Comparable performance indicates consistent wastage measurement results.
- The new process performs well, maintaining consistent wastage levels across different operators.

## Ancient Skulls Analysis

In this problem, the lengths of ancient skulls from two sites in Tibet are analyzed.

Conducting a Bayesian analysis for μ1 − μ2:
- Average Difference: The skulls from the first site are, on average, about 10.9 millimeters shorter than those from the second site.
- Variability: Measurements vary, with the shortest difference around 27.9 millimeters and the longest about 1.3 millimeters. This suggests that, overall, skulls from the first site tend to be shorter than those from the second site.
